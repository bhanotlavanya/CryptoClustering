# CryptoClustering


This repository demonstrates the application of unsupervised learning (using SciKit-Learn) to analyze cryptocurrency data. Price fluctuations of various cryptocurrencies were examined over different time intervals using K-means clustering. Initially, the data was normalized with StandardScaler, followed by generating an elbow chart to determine the optimal number of clusters (k). The K-means algorithm was then applied to group cryptocurrencies based on similar price movement patterns, which can assist in making informed investment decisions and identifying outliers.

Next, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted with three principal components, capturing 89% of the original variance. The elbow chart and K-means clustering were performed again on the PCA-transformed data. While the optimal number of clusters (k) was at 4, the pca method gave other options as well such as 2,3,4, the elbow chart displayed a clearer inflection point. Additionally, the clusters formed in the reduced dimensional space were more distinct and tightly grouped, reflecting the benefits of dimensionality reduction from the original dataset.
